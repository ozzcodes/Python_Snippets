he didn't like the food. She never did. She made the usual complaints and started the tantrum he knew was coming. But this time was different. 
Instead of trying to placate her and her unreasonable demands, he just stared at her and watched her meltdown without saying a word.
He knew what he was supposed to do. That had been apparent from the beginning. That was what made the choice so difficult. What he was 
supposed to do and what he would do were not the same. This would have been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences, but he wasn't.
He sat staring at the person in the train stopped at the station going in the opposite direction. She sat staring ahead, never noticing that 
she was being watched. Both trains began to move and he knew that in another timeline or in another universe, they had been happy together.
She asked the question even though she didn't really want to hear the answer. It was a no-win situation since she already knew. If he told the

she asked the question anyway and waited for his answer.
She looked at her little girl who was about to become a teen. She tried to think back to when the girl had been younger but failed to pinpoint the 
exact moment when she had become a little too big to pick up and carry. It hit her all at once. She was no longer a little girl and she stood there 
speechless with fear, sadness, and pride all running through her at the same time.
